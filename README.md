This is a basic MPLS L3VPN network built in GNS3 to understand this technolgy. My first contact with MPLS was when I was studying my CCNP RS back in 2009. In the curriculum of CCNP in that time there was a brilliant lab that get you to the basics of building a MPLS L3VPN and that has always been my base since then.

This lab is built on c7200-adventerprisek9-mz.124-24.T2

My laptop is running Debian 10 Testing, Intel i7 and 8GB RAM.

This is the network diagram
